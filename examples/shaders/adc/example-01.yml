##
# This example connects the brightness of each pixel in the webcam to the module ADC (analog digital converter),
# which in turn provides 3 outputs that act as bits describing the value numerically.
#
# adc provides the outputs out1, out2, and out3 so it can be used as an "out" module.
##

# Define a module called "external".
external:
    # Specify that it be of the type "builtin/webcam"
    module: builtin/webcam

# Define a second module called external_decoded
# This mapper provides coloring information. We are interested in the lumanince
external_decoded:
    # Specify that it be of the type "shaders/rgb_mapper"
    module: shaders/rgb_mapper
    # Provide the outputs of the webcam to this mapper
    inputs:
        red: external.red
        green: external.green
        blue: external.blue

# Define another module using the special name "out"
# Its output (if the outputs are out1, out2, out3 OR red, green, blue OR value) will be shown on your screen
out:
    # If you're curious about the code to this module, you can follow the path specified here (an additional extension added
    # according to the class of module). In this case it's shaders/adc.frag
    module: shaders/adc
    inputs:
        value: external_decoded.luma
