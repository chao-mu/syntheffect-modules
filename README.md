# syntheffect-modules

This repository is a proof of concept to explore the ideal of hosting modules and shaders for use with SynthEffect outside 
the SynthEffect repository. 

See https://syntheffect.com/


## Getting started

```
./update.sh
```

## Layout

* shaders/core - core shaders part of syntheffect
* shaders/include - common includes for shaders
* shaders/github.com/* - github usersnames, underwhich submodules of that user's repositories that contain shaders
